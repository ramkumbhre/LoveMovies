# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This repository is  a **movie-related web application** named "LoveMovies." The project seems to be built using **React** as the frontend framework, along with **Vite** as the build tool (based on the presence of `vite.config.js`). It contains various components and pages, which likely represent different features or views for browsing and interacting with movie data.

### Key aspects of the repository:
- **Front-End Framework**: React (`App.jsx`, `main.jsx`) and JSX components for structuring the web interface.
- **SCSS for Styling**: The use of `.scss` files indicates that **Sass** is being used for styling, providing more flexibility and features compared to standard CSS.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool (`vite.config.js`) to bundle and serve the application.
- **State Management**: The `store/` folder, containing `store.js` and `homeSlice.js`, suggests that **Redux Toolkit** or a similar state management library is used.
- **Custom Hooks**: The `useFetch.jsx` file suggests a custom hook is utilized to fetch data, probably from some external API.
- **Routing**: Pages like `Home`, `Explore`, `SearchResult`, and `404` point to different routes for various functionalities of the application, such as browsing movies, searching, and handling errors.
- **Components**: Many components (`Carousel`, `Genres`, `Footer`, `Header`, etc.) are modular and reused throughout the app.
- **Movie Functionality**: Components like `CircleRating`, `MovieCard`, `VideoPopUp`, and `Cast` likely serve specific features like displaying movie ratings, details, and related media (trailers, cast information).

### Likely Functionality:
- **Home Page**: The app probably has a home page displaying popular, trending, top-rated, and upcoming movies (based on the folder names in `pages/home/`).
- **Movie Details**: The `Details` folder suggests a detailed view for each movie, showing cast, recommendations, and possibly related movies.
- **Explore/Search**: The `Explore` and `SearchResult` pages suggest the user can search for and explore movies by genres or other criteria.
- **User Interaction**: It likely features interactive elements like carousels for movies, pop-up videos (trailers), and a rating system.
- **API Integration**: The `utils/api.js` file indicates that the app fetches data from an external API, possibly to retrieve movie details, ratings, etc.
